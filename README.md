Here is the link to the Magic Mirror software:
https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror.git

You can find all of the installation instructions on how to get the Magic Mirror software up and running at that link.
It is good to note that there is also a page within their website that instructs you on how to make your own module, however,
the module run using Node.JS/Javascipt so it is not a clean transfer.

The end goal for this project is to create a Magic Mirror Module ("MMM"), for the python program to be able to interact
with the magic mirror.

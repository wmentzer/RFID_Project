The current state of this project is not completed, the current version only takes advantage of the MFRC522 libraries as well as a written Python program to display input and output within a terminal window.

Here is the link to the Magic Mirror software:
https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror.git

You can find all of the installation instructions on how to get the Magic Mirror software up and running at that link.
It is good to note that there is also a page within their website that instructs you on how to make your own module, however,
the module run using Node.JS/Javascipt so it is not a clean transfer.

The end goal for this project is to create a Magic Mirror Module ("MMM"), for the python program to be able to interact
with the magic mirror.
